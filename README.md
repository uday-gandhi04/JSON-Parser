Here's a professional and informative `README.md` file you can use for your JSON Parser project:

# 🌐 JSON Parser

A sleek and interactive **JSON Parser Web App** that allows users to **parse**, **beautify**, and **minify** JSON data using a **custom-built lexer and parser** written in JavaScript. The app also includes a clean UI and animations powered by **Lottie**, making it both functional and visually appealing.


---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ **Custom Lexer & Parser**: Parses JSON without relying on `JSON.parse()` — built entirely from scratch.
* 🎨 **Beautify JSON**: Format and indent JSON for better readability.
* 🔧 **Minify JSON**: Remove whitespace and compress JSON to a single line.
* ✨ **Lottie Animation**: Adds a fun animated component to the interface.
* 🌙 **Dark-Themed Code Highlighting**: Uses Highlight.js with the Atom One Dark theme for parsed output.
* 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile.

## 🧠 How It Works

* A **custom lexer** tokenizes the JSON input string into tokens like `{`, `}`, `:`, strings, numbers, etc.
* A **recursive descent parser** processes these tokens to reconstruct the original JavaScript object.
* **Beautify** and **Minify** functions use the same parser output and re-serialize using `JSON.stringify`.

---

## 🐛 Error Handling

If the JSON input is invalid:

* An error message is shown to the user.
* The output area is cleared to avoid confusion.
